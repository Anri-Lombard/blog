Ever since coming to Cape Town to study, I wanted to see some must-sees, so my friends helped me set up a bucket list. Near the top of the list is Keurboom Park, since it's right next to me and the perfect adventure for the next loadshedding (a scheduled electricity shut-off).

# The Park

I discovered _aperture mode_ on my phone that makes photos look nice, so decided to turn into Photographer Anri.

## Tiny stuff
There were some cool details, luckily it was raining and I had an empty park to myself.

## Big stuff
Even the big stuff was pretty!

If Harry Potter did not run through a train station wall, I'm sure this is a good alternative to Hogwarts.

The Harry Potter Willow! Wait a minute... what's happenin' here?

Such friendly residents. This one even waved at me.

Now we know why load-shedding happens: it's a cue to micro-adventure.

# Bonus

The Stormers rugby team passed me on one of the famous red busses.
