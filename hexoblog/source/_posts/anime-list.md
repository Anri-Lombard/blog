What's better than reading a book? Reading subtitles on an Anime movie.

In high school, I avoided television like it was the plague; I still do, but Anime is an art and exception.

These are great:
1. **Spirited Away**

5. **Princess Mononoke**

6. **Violet Evergarden** (Common question: Why are my eyes wet?)

7. **Bubble**

8. **A whisker away** (Bad if this is the reason I get a cat?)

9.  **Demon Slayer the Movie: Mugen Train** - also the highest grossing anime movie in history.

This concludes my trip down the anime rabbit hole. I learned more from it than from most books, but I am not overstaying my welcome.
