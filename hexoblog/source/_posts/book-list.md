I've been reading books since I turned 15; It started out as a hobby to replace playing video games, but quickly engulfed my time to become a minor obsession.

It has burgeoned to be an ever-itching ache that needs attending, even through periods of harsh restriction of extracurriculars (examinations) that require tunnel vision on narrow topics. Its benefits, however, have proven to outweigh its costs; here is an exploration of what my reading has taught me thus far.

I commonly refrain from ratings, as each book should be taken at face value, and for what it contributes. Therefore each deserves its own podium spot.

# Non-fiction
1. **Atomic Habits** by James Clear

*Most Practical Takeaways:*
- We are the result of our habits
- Habits are results of our environments
- To achieve ambitious goals we must engineer environments that allow us to reach them

*My Experience:*
- I've read this book 5 times fully by now; I am still bad at habits, but a much better person following my awareness, admission, and attempt to improve at their construction - as my friends would hopefully confess.
- James has mentioned that he skimped on emphasizing "the people you spend time with" in the book. With experimental data I could affirm a replication of his assumption: in fact, nothing in my life sticks when there is a deficiency of friends that reflect the value I aspire to; I am only a good student with studious friends, a healthy person with Joe Rogan, Lex Fridman, and Andrew Huberman whispering in my ear of its benefits, a great coder with entrepreneurs speaking to me through long-form Youtube videos about technologies influence and the compounding effect of consistency...
- My first question is "what people could influence me better?" before "what environment would be useful?" since without it collateral damage seems inevitable.

2. **Deep Work** by Cal Newport

*Most Practical Takeaways:*
- Focus is a limited, trainable resource
- Deep work is ever-scarcer in an ever-noisier world

*My Experience:*
- I don't like this book.
- In high school, this was essential to me; It got me from an average student to achieving high grades accross the board, but it seems fundamentally useless as I observe successful people and my friends who achieve highly in what they do. My argument is this: focus should not be optimised, matching with the activity you're doing should be. Once there is a good match, "passion" can emerge, and then focus is a good adjustable variable.
- This book has been both a catapult and an obstacle for me, both being useful enough for me to reccomend it.

- ksldjfls
- laskdjflks

*My Experience:*

4. **Factfulness** by Anna Rosling RÃ¶nnlund, Hans Rosling, and Ola Rosling

*Most Practical Taheaways:*
- The world is fundametally better than we make it out to be

*My Experience:*
- I read this book in 2019, and it's still one of the single biggest contributors to my life philosophy.
- When friends and family freak out about the world's end I could focus on why: news is incentivised to be about crisises, because humans are programmed to notice what's wrong and dismiss what's good. A better way to look at bad news is "The world is bad, and getting better".
- When my parents reminice about the great old days, where aparteit was simply the best economic times since white people obviously know better, I realise they are wrong and look at the past with rosy-tinted glasses. My family's racial tension pushed me to have virtually no white friends so my immersion in diversity could hide the tainting effect of the past.

5. **Elon Musk** by Ashlee Vance

*Most Practical Takeaways:*
- Elon is not a genius, he was a young boy who read a lot of books, got inspired by the ideas and characters withing then, hardened his resolve to escape the horrible childhood conditions his father gave him, noticed South Africa's stupidity to waste talent for the sake of keeping black people opressed - thereby aiming to live in America where most of the great technologists and ideas he read about bloomed. He did not need guts to go to America alone, because the alternative life his father had for him was much worse.

*My Experience:*
- Elon Musk stays a figure I aspire to emulate; the contoversies around him is unescapable in a world of social media platforms spreading free speech virally. Just like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg he will be painted as a villian or hero alternatively depending on some famous person's mood, but these four humans has made the world a better place, and inspire me to do the same.
