Covid took quite a toll on students when it first showed in 2020 - my matric year, in fact; but left us experienced in life online. We had to work online, study thoroughly with only laptops as our guides, and over time learn to enjoy the long emails and zoom hangouts; a few, myself included, learned to study independently with the trove of resources online.

## Coding online
I’m no expert, but over time I’ll be good enough to say this was my advice as a beginner: learn a bit, code a bit, and work on what excites you most as much as you can.

Since all advice is personal, let my experience be a demonstration:
### 2020:

An insignificant little dot, but a significant step; actually, this was the week I decided to study computer science instead of medicine.

### 2021
I started learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript during my final exam week and distinctly remember asking for an online course as a Christman present; my first online course: The Complete Web Developer Bootcamp. It took me about 9 months to finish it, but let's use the excuse that I was "spacially retrieving," although freshman year was to blame.

This year I built a few personal websites and scoped the landscape of what computer science has to offer; I learned about Competitive Programming, Github, and Software Internships - the three pillars of a college CS student. I wasn't good at CP, and it takes dedication to become great - so I decided to focus on my strengths of reading and writing to do research.

This led me to Machine Learning and Coursera:

My freshman year of college was entirely online and hence not interesting; I had time to stimulate my mind with online courses through Coursera that were virtually free with engaging communities and fascinating teachers.

I started liking coding more and gained some traction. Over weekends and holidays, I could set school work aside and work on personal projects; It is now a long way since that first green dot on 31 December 2020.

### 2022
I'm still only a beginner, even after all this time. I still make mistakes and find my Ivy League friends admirable for starting so young; I still practice the basics, but I'm more aware of all that I don't know, which satisfies me.

My take on this is that it's easy to learn a lot if we've got some time and enthusiasm.

## Meeting people online
People are shy and cautious online as they should, but it makes having a conversation more difficult. It seems like being polite and respecting their time softens them a bit.

Platforms to easily connect are:
- Linkedin
- WhatsApp
- Instagram
"Online Games" and "Omegle" probably works, but I can't comment since I don't use them.

### The strategy
1. Find a reason to talk to them; Mine is usually asking for advice or congratulating them.
2. Politely wait for them to answer on their time.
3. Be kind and let them be. Some people want to become friends, others want to be left alone. Either is fine.

### The results
I've met 2 kids from MIT studying computer science, a few more from Harvard studying business, a lot more from UCT, and some people at companies I'd like to work at. Some are talkative, some aren't, but I respect both types.

In one instance I even started doing research a year earlier than UCT allowed it. I even made a few lasting friends, which makes it worth it.


## Studying online
Being a student online is hard for me. I need a community to find learning fun, and fun to find the content interesting. Despite popular belief, I'm not a robot. There are, however, a few interesting lessons I've picked up.

### Distraction
It's hard when Netflix, Youtube, and School are only a browser tab apart, especially for students that like watching Anime, but I found 2 tricks:
1. Schedule it, so that there's time to get distracted, just not when studying.
2. 10-minute rule: once you want distraction, start a 10-minute timer. 10 minutes is a good time to lose interest.

### Interest
In University I pick my subjects, so there's no reason to pick something I'd hate. I even left Physics Freshman year since it took much time away from programming; there are a few tricks that kept me interested in subjects:
1. Make studious friends in the class. Their jubilance rubs off.
2. I attend tuts and try to explain to the tutor what I've learned. Sometimes I correct the tutor, but they seem to enjoy the engagement.


Hopefully, we get to be more in person and enjoy learning normally, but online has its perks!
