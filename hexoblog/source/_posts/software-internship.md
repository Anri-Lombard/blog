I recently started an internship at a startup. Boy, it's fun! But like a startup, this blog is a work in progress until we finish the internship.

# Goal
Build a data-tagging application.

# How we're doing it
## Yes, I said WE
Usually I code alone, but we decided to get another member or two on board since startups need future employees. Lucky for me we got a good friend from school - she and I coincidentally did the same statistics class I mentioned in a past blog, so we'll be hypothesisinginging... and stuff.

We got another potential friend if he chooses to take on the challenge.
**UPDATE:** nah, just us 2.

Naturally, one starts a cult. I mean a group:

## Planning

It turns out we need to learn Docker since I've never used it.

Figma is useful to get some ideas out on how this thing needs to look. Looking funky for now.

I like the team thing and learning to use the MERN stack since most companies like the skillset.
